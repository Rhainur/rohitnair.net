						I'm Rohit Nair, a tech geek who enjoys tinkering with software
						development, graphics design and computers in general. I'm
						interested in just about everything to do with computers, from
						programming to networking to UI/UX design. Although I
						spend a significant amount of time using Photoshop and
						Illustrator, I'd rather design an elegant software solution
						than a beautiful website or wallpaper.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: center">
						I'm currently working on: <strong>Learning Web Development using Clojure</strong>

						I tend to focus on web technologies, and the vast
						majority of my development has been focused around the
						popular combination of an HTML/CSS/JS
						frontend with a PHP/MySQL backend generating
						the content. For a majority of my PHP projects, I've used either CodeIgniter
						or Laravel to speed up the development
						process and produce clean maintainable code.
						Recently, I've transitioned to Ruby on Rails for my web development
						work, due to its ease of use, not to mention
						Ruby's vastly superior design and consistency compared to PHP.
						</p>
						<p>
						Other languages,technologies and frameworks I've worked with
						include PostgreSQL, jQuery, Dojo Toolkit, Wordpress and more.
						I've also spent significant time
						developing in a variety of non-web programming
						languages such as C, C++, and
						Java.
						</p>
						<p>
						You can find some of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/Rhainur">Github</a>. I also offer free introductory classes for web
						development and programming over Skype. Please check out
						the tutoring section to learn more.

						My interests have shifted from design towards

						When I'm not programming or designing, you'll find me
						lifting weights. In the gym, I structure my workouts
						around raw strength and explosive power development. I
						tend to focus on the big three lifts, and my current
						maxes are a 105kg bench, 160kg squat and 200kg deadlift.
						I've combined my love of developing web applications
						with my passion for fitness and created 3 fitness apps.

						The Program Picker was designed to simplify the process
						of choosing an appropriate exercise routine. Via a
						series of questions, it directs you to the most
						appropriate exercise program for your goal and
						experience level.

						The only thing I enjoy more than gathering knowledge is
						spreading it. I have experience in many sub-fields of the
						leviathan known as "IT", and while I am particularly
						experienced with the items pictured above, I can teach the
						basics of many other topics (such as C, C++, Java,
						networking, etc). I may not make you a programming guru,
						but I can definitely get you to the point where you can
						Google anything you need, and comfortably understand the
						tutorials.

							<h4>Requirements</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>You must have Skype, a microphone and a decent connection: </strong>
									I rely on voice chat and screen sharing for
									my teaching, so this is a necessity. Time
									zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle
									East ), but I've taught over 40 people in
									the US so far, ranging from coast to coast,
									and it hasn't been an issue.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You must have decent English skills:</strong>
									I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature,
									but teaching, <em>especially</em> when it's
									computer related, will be much easier if we
									can understand each other easily.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You need to be motivated enough to
									practice a little on your own:</strong> The
									process of learning will be a lot smoother if,
									for every hour that I teach you, you spend an
									hour practicing on your own, just messing
									around with stuff. Note that I'll still teach
									you even if you don't practice, it's just that
									you'll learn faster if you do.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You have to <em>want</em> to <em>learn</em>:</strong>
									I have added 200+ "students" to my contact list, many
									of whom have never even bothered messaging me
									after the initial add (some never even confirmed
									the add request). Some people have given me
									reasons for why they're busy at the moment and
									wish to delay classes, and I'm perfectly okay
									with that, but please don't just add me on a
									whim. Good design and programming takes mental
									effort, and the least you can do in exchange for
									free classes is to be committed to learning.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>
						If you're interested, and you feel you satisfy the requirements, just email me at
						<a href="mailto:admin@rohitnair.net">admin@rohitnair.net</a>. Include your Skype ID
						and a rough idea of what you want to learn.
