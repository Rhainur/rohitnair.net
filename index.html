						I'm Rohit Nair, a tech geek who enjoys tinkering with software
						development, graphics design and computers in general. I'm
						interested in just about everything to do with computers, from
						programming to networking to UI/UX design. Although I
						spend a significant amount of time using Photoshop and
						Illustrator, I'd rather design an elegant software solution
						than a beautiful website or wallpaper.
						</p>

						<p>
						I tend to focus on web technologies, and while I started out doing PHP development, I've been working with Ruby on Rails for the last 5 years. Cleanness and simplicity are my main priorities when I'm coding, which is why I found myself drawn to Ruby, and while I may not agree with all the design decisions in Rails, it's an excellent fit for most of the web applications I work on.
						</p>
						<p>
						I've also done minor projects and hobbyist stuff in NodeJS, Clojure, Haskell and Erlang. My approach to web development tends to be more pragmatic than ideological, and in the end, the best language is the one that gets the job done with the least hassle.
						</p>
						<p>
						You can find some of my projects on <a href="http://github.com/Rhainur">Github</a>. I also offer free introductory classes for web
						development and programming over Skype. Please check out
						the tutoring section to learn more.

						My interests have shifted from design towards
						development over the years, but I still play around
						in Photoshop and Illustrator from time to time. Here
						are a few of my recent creations.

							My main hobby/obsession is table tennis. When I'm not at the
							computer, I'm almost always at my local table tennis club
							practicing hard at becoming a two-wing looper. Eventually, I
							hope to reach a point where I'm skillful enough that posting a
							video of my play online won't embarass me.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have a tendency to convert my obsessions into a coding
							project. When I was teaching myself the basics of HTML5
							video, I created a simple "service anticipation" game for <a
							href="http://ace.rohitnair.net" target="blank">table tennis</a>
							and <a href="http://ace-tennis.rohitnair.net" target="blank">tennis</a>.
							I'm also working on an implementation of the Elo rating system
							along with an easy to use interface that will make it easier to
							track table tennis tournaments.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before I started focusing exclusively on table tennis, my fitness
							regime was focused around weight training. I tended to structure
							my workout around the three big lifts, and my maxes are a 105kg
							bench, 160kg squat and 200kg deadlift. I spent a lot of time
							participating in fitness communities/forums during this time, and
							created a couple of simple web apps to try and help answer the most
							frequently asked questions.

						The Program Picker was designed to simplify the process
						of choosing an appropriate exercise routine. Via a
						series of questions, it directs you to the most
						appropriate exercise program for your goal and
						experience level.

						The only thing I enjoy more than gathering knowledge is
						spreading it. I've dabbled in many sub-fields of the
						leviathan known as "IT", and while I am particularly
						experienced with the items pictured above, I can teach the
						basics of many other topics (such as C, C++, Java,
						networking, etc). I may not make you a programming guru,
						but I can definitely get you to the point where you can
						Google anything you need, and comfortably understand the
						tutorials.

							<h4>Requirements</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>You must have Skype, a microphone and a decent connection: </strong>
									I rely on voice chat and screen sharing for
									my teaching, so this is a necessity. Time
									zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle
									East ), but I've taught over 40 people in
									the US so far, ranging from coast to coast,
									and it hasn't been an issue.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You must have decent English skills:</strong>
									I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature,
									but teaching, <em>especially</em> when it's
									computer related, will be much easier if we
									can understand each other easily.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You need to be motivated enough to
									practice a little on your own:</strong> The
									process of learning will be a lot smoother if,
									for every hour that I teach you, you spend an
									hour practicing on your own, just messing
									around with stuff. Note that I'll still teach
									you even if you don't practice, it's just that
									you'll learn faster if you do.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>You have to <em>want</em> to <em>learn</em>:</strong>
									I have added 200+ "students" to my contact list, many
									of whom have never even bothered messaging me
									after the initial add (some never even confirmed
									the add request). Some people have given me
									reasons for why they're busy at the moment and
									wish to delay classes, and I'm perfectly okay
									with that, but please don't just add me on a
									whim. Good design and programming takes mental
									effort, and the least you can do in exchange for
									free classes is to be committed to learning.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<p>
						If you're interested, and you feel you satisfy the requirements, just email me at
						<a href="mailto:admin@rohitnair.net">admin@rohitnair.net</a>. Include your Skype ID
						and a rough idea of what you want to learn.
